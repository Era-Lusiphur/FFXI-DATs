# FFXI-DATs

Various Final Fantasy XI DATs. See the index below for a description of what each is for specifically.

I recommend loading them with the addon XIPivot to test them on your install and server before overwritting them on top of your actual install.

## Classic Group 2 Merits

This one file will give a player access to the original Group 2 merits that Square has since replaced on retail installs. This will enable a player on a classic private server to purchase them correctly.

## Classic MP Cost & Casting Times

Adjusts spell casting times and MP cost to 75 Era, very useful on many private servers.
