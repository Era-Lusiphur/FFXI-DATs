# FFXI-DATs

Various Final Fantasy XI DATs. See the index below for a description of what each is for specifically.

I recommend loading them with the addon XIPivot to test them on your install and server before overwritting them on top of your actual install.

## Classic Group 2 Merits

This one file will give a player access to the original Group 2 merits that Square has since replaced on retail installs. This will enable a player on a classic private server to purchase them correctly.

This file was sourced from a retail install and dated March 10th, 2017.

## Classic MP Cost & Casting Times

Adjusts spell casting times and MP cost to 75 Era, very useful on many private servers. This file was produced for the Era DSP private server and enables users of Ashitacast to swap gear correctly on such a server.

## FFXI Retail Patch for Era

This is a retail patch for Era players that smooths over a lot of mission and quest issues. It includes the above two DAT mods packed in.
